# Blockchain Intuition


## a.What is Blockchain ?

Digital hash is like a fingerprint of some amount of data. So the block here has its own hash and then the previous hash which is contained within the block as  a reference is actually the hash of the block that came before it.


### 1.Genesis block


#### Basic Of Genesis Block 

This block is always going to be the first one assuming there's some data it doesn't have a previous hash inside this block because this is the jettisons block is the only block that will

have a previous hash. So we're just going to present them all zeros and then it will have its own hash again.For now let's think of hash as a fingerprint.

There is block number two and a book on Mattoo also has some data.This time it does have a previous hash and it has its own hash again.

And as you can see the block is the previous hash of block number two is exactly identical or is exactly block number ones hash and that is where the link comes.That is why abortion is called a chain or a block chain because the blocks are cryptographically linked with each other through these hashes.And again more of that not to come.


#### Conclusion:

But this is conceptually hard work: every brought block has its own fingerprint and it also references the fingerprints of the previous block.So if anything were to change and block number one it's fingerprint would change.So if anything were to change here

anything would change in the data.So somebody were to tamper with the data.This fingerprint would change and it would no longer match this fingerprint.So this block would know or we would know by looking at this block that somebody tampered with this block.


##### Cryptographically Linked 

And then again looking at the three data it's got the previous hash it's got its own hash and it's linked to the so on and so on.So again Conceptually we can see that if anybody were to tamper with any block this one and this one then the fingerprints would no longer match up and the chain would be invalid the chain would show that there's something wrong.

**That's why we say that blocks are cryptographically linked together.**


###  2.Concept of Blockchain 
1.Consensus Protocol
2.Mining
3.Hash Cryptography
4.Distributed P2P Network
5.Immutable Ledger


## b.SHA256 - Hash
